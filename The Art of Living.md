## 1. Know what you can control and what you can't
明白哪些是你能掌控的，哪些是你不能掌控的

Happiness and freedom begin with a clear understanding of one principle: Some things are within our control, and some things are not.

幸福与自由始于一个清晰的原则：有些事在我们掌控之中，有些事不在

It is only after you have faced up to this fundamental rule and learned to distinguish between what you can and can't control that inner tranquility and outer effectiveness become possible. 

唯有直面这一根本法则，并学会分辨哪些是你能掌控的、哪些是你不能掌控的，内在的宁静与外在的成效才会成为可能


Within our control are our own opinions, aspirations, desires, and the things that repel us. These areas are quite rightly our concern, because they are directly subject to our influence. We always have a choice about the contents and character of our inner lives.

在我们掌控之中的，是我们的观点、志向、欲望，以及那些令我们厌恶的事物。这些领域理所当然属于我们的关注，因为它们直接受我们的影响。我们始终可以选择自己内心世界的内容与品格

Outside our control, however, are such things as what kind of body we have, whether we're born into wealth or strike it rich, how we are regarded by others, and our status in society. We must remember that those things are externals and are therefore not our concern. Trying to control or to change what we can't only results in torment.

不在我们掌控之中的，是我们的身体状况、出生时是否富有或后来是否致富、他人如何看待我们，以及我们在社会中的地位。我们必须记住，这些都是外在之物，因此不应成为我们的关注。试图去掌控或改变那些我们无法掌控的事，只会带来痛苦

Remember: The things within our power are naturally at our disposal, free from any restraint or hindrance; but those things outside our power are weak, dependent, or determined by the whims and actions of others. Remember, too, that if you think that you have free rein over things that are naturally beyond your control, or if you attempt to adopt the affairs of others as your won, your pursuits will be thwarted and you will become a frustrated, anxious, and fault-finding person.

记住：在我们掌控之中的事物，自然任由我们支配，不受任何限制或阻碍；但那些不在我们掌控之中的事物，则是脆弱的、依赖的，或由他人的意志与行为所决定。再记住，如果你以为自己能随心所欲地掌控那些本不属于你掌控的事物，或者试图把他人的事务当作自己的，你的追求必将受挫，你也会变得沮丧、焦虑、挑剔

## 2 Stick with your own business 
守己之事，不涉他务

Keep your attention focused entirely on what is truly your own concern, and be clear that what belongs to others is their business and none of yours. If you do this, you will be impervious to coercion and no one can ever hold you back. You will be truly free and effective, for your efforts will be put to good use and won't be foolishly squandered finding fault with or opposing others.

将注意力完全专注于真正属于你自己的事务，并清楚地认识到属于他人的事是他们的事，而不是你的。如果你能做到这一点，你将不受胁迫，也不会被任何人阻碍。你将真正自由而高效，因为你的努力会被合理运用，而不会被愚蠢地浪费在挑剔或反对他人上

In knowing and attending to what actually concerns you, you cannot be made to do anything against your will; others can't hurt you, you don't incur enemies or suffer harm 

当你明白并专注于真正属于你自己的事务时，你就不会被迫做违背意愿的事；他人无法伤害你，你也不会树敌或遭受损害 

If you aim to live by such principles, remember that it won't be easy: you must give up some things entirely; and postpone others for now. You may well have to forego wealth and power if you want to assure the attainment of happiness and freedom 

如果你立志依循这些原则生活，请记住这并不容易：你必须彻底放弃一些事物；而另一些则需要暂时搁置。若你想确保获得幸福与自由，你很可能必须舍弃财富与权力

## 3 Recognize appearances for what they really are

识其貌，明其真

From now on, practice saying to everything that appears unpleasant: "You are just an appearance and by no means what you appear to be." And then thoroughly consider the matter according to the principles just discussed, primarily: Does this appearance concern the things that are within my own control or those that are not? If it concerns anything outside your control, train yourself not to worry about it

从现在开始，凡是看起来不愉快的事，都练习对它说：‘你只是一个表象，绝非你看起来的那样。’然后依据我们刚才讨论的原则彻底审视这件事，首先要问：这个表象涉及的是我可控的事，还是不可控的事？如果它涉及任何不在你掌控之内的东西，就训练自己不为之忧

## 4 Desire demands its own attainment 

欲望要求自身被实现 

Our desires and aversions are mercurial rulers. They demand to be pleased. Desire commands us to run off and get what we want.

欲望与厌恶如同善变的君主，总要人侍奉。欲望一声令下，我们便奔去追求所欲之物。

Aversion insists that we must avoid the things that repel us.

厌恶如令：凡使我生厌者，皆当远避。
